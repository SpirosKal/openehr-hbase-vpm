The summary of archetypes (reused, newly developed and modified) from our work can be used by other researchers/clinicians/developers for the representation of clinical information.
We provide public access to these archetypes to enable semantic interoperability for ageing-related systems that will be developed in the future.

Furthermore, this repository provides access to an application (example) of a methodology for a one-to-one mapping between openEHR archetypes and an Hbase schema. It can be considered as a notable guide for other developers.

Our work was partially supported by the FrailSafe Project (H2020-PHC-21-2015-690140) ”Sensing and predictive treatment of frailty and associated comorbidities using advanced personalized models and advanced interventions”, co-funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 research and innovation program.
